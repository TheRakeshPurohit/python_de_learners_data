Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope in the mid-2020s.[42][43] The Rubin Observatory's 8.4-meter (28\\\\\\\\u00a0ft) aperture telescope and 3.5\\\\\\\\u00a0square-degree field of view will probe Jupiter's irregular moons down to diameters of 1\\\\\\\\u00a0km (0.6\\\\\\\\u00a0mi)[10]:\\\\\\\\u200a265\\\\\\\\u200a at apparent magnitudes of 24.5, with the potential of increasing the known population by up to tenfold.[42]:\\\\\\\\u200a292\\\\\\\\u200a Likewise, the Roman Space Telescope's 2.4-meter (7.9\\\\\\\\u00a0ft) aperture and 0.28\\\\\\\\u00a0square-degree field of view will probe Jupiter's irregular moons down to diameters of 0.3\\\\\\\\u00a0km (0.2\\\\\\\\u00a0mi) at magnitude 27.7, with the potential of discovering approximately 1,000 Jovian moons above this size.[43]:\\\\\\\\u200a24\\\\\\\\u200a Discovering these many irregular satellites will help reveal their population's size distribution and collisional histories, which will place further constraints to how the Solar System formed.[43]:\\\\\\\\u200a24\\\\\\\\u201325\\\\\\\\nDiscovery of outer planet moons\\\\\\\\nNaming[edit]\\\\\\\\nThe Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) were named by Simon Marius soon after their discovery in 1610.[44] No additional moons were discovered until two decades later, with the fortuitous discovery of Callirrhoe by the Spacewatch survey in October 1999.[25] During the 1990s, photographic plates phased out as digital charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras began emerging in telescopes on Earth, allowing for wide-field surveys of the sky at unprecedented sensitivities and ushering in a wave of new moon discoveries.[26] Scott Sheppard, then a graduate student of David Jewitt, demonstrated this extended capability of CCD cameras in a survey conducted with the Mauna Kea Observatory's 2.2-meter (88\\\\\\\\u00a0in) UH88 telescope in November 2000, discovering eleven new irregular moons of Jupiter including the previously lost Themisto with the aid of automated computer algorithms.[27]\\\\\\\\nFrom 2001 onward, Sheppard and Jewitt alongside other collaborators continued surveying for Jovian irregular moons with the 3.6-meter (12\\\\\\\\u00a0ft) Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), discovering an additional eleven in December 2001, one in October 2002, and nineteen in February 2003.[27][1] The other moons were simply labeled by their Roman numeral (e.g. Jupiter IX) in the majority of astronomical literature until the 1970s.[50] Several different suggestions were made for names of Jupiter's outer satellites, but none were universally accepted until 1975 when the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Task Group for Outer Solar System Nomenclature granted names to satellites V\\\\\\\\u2013XIII,[51] and provided for a formal naming process for future satellites still to be discovered.[51] The practice was to name newly discovered moons of Jupiter after lovers and favorites of the god Jupiter (Zeus) and, since 2004, also after their descendants.[48] All of Jupiter's satellites from XXXIV (Euporie) onward are named after descendants of Jupiter or Zeus,[48] except LIII (Dia), named after a lover of Jupiter. Names ending with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"o\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are used for prograde irregular satellites (the latter for highly inclined satellites), and names ending with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"e\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are used for retrograde irregulars.[26] With the discovery of smaller, kilometre-sized moons around Jupiter, the IAU has established an additional convention to limit the naming of small moons with absolute magnitudes greater than 18 or diameters smaller than 1\\\\\\\\u00a0km (0.6\\\\\\\\u00a0mi).[52] Some of the most recently confirmed moons have not received names.[4]\\\\\\\\nSome asteroids share the same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 Metis, 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. The first were Pioneer\\\\\\\\u00a010 in 1973, and Pioneer\\\\\\\\u00a011 a year later, taking low-resolution images of the four Galilean moons and returning data on their atmospheres and radiation belts.[72] The Voyager\\\\\\\\u00a01 and Voyager\\\\\\\\u00a02 probes visited Jupiter in 1979, discovering the volcanic activity on\\\\\\\\u00a0Io and the presence of water ice on the surface of Europa.\\\\\\\"}\\\", \\\"{\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://nineplanets.org/questions/how-many-moons-does-jupiter-have/\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"It is also the fourth-largest moon in the Solar System, yet it has the highest density and the least amount of water molecules of any known celestial object in the Solar System.\\\\\\\\n Many missions are planned for Jupiter in the following years, and many of them target the four biggest moons of Jupiter, the Galilean Moons.
