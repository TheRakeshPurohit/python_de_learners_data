Large Language Models: Capabilities, Advancements, and Limitations [2024]
Large language models (LLMs) are the unsung heroes of recent Generative AI advancements, quietly working behind the scenes to understand and generate language as we know it.
But how do they work? What are they capable of? And what should we look out for when using them?
Understanding Large Language Models
What is a Large Language Model?
A large language model, often abbreviated to LLM, is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand natural language as well as generate it at a large scale.
When we say human language, we don’t just mean English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Those are certainly part of what LLMs are trained on but human language, in this context, also extends to:LLMs are trained on billions of parameters and have the ability to learn from a wide range of data sources.

Title:
Content: Scalability and Environmental Impact
The scalability of LLMs is tied to the impact it has on the environment. And that impact is turning out to be a big one.
Training a system like GPT-3 took 1,287 Megawatt hours (MWh) of energy. To put that into perspective, 1 MWh could power about 330 homes for one hour in the United States.
The image below shows the energy consumption of training four different LLMs.
Energy consumption doesn’t end at training—operating LLMs also uses a grotesque level of energy.
In one report, Alex de Vries, founder of Digiconomist, has calculated that by 2027 the AI sector will consume between 85 to 134 Terawatt hours each year. That’s almost the same as the annual energy demand of the Netherlands.
We can’t help but wonder how sustainable that is and what the long-term environmental impact will be on our energy sources. Especially when you consider LLMs are only going to become larger and more complex as we advance their capabilities.

Title:
Content: How did we do? Our four big bets for 2023 were that the next big thing in chatbots would be multimodal (check: the most powerful large language models out there, OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, work with text, images and audio); that policymakers would draw up tough new regulations (check: Biden’s executive order came out in October and the European Union’s AI Act was finally agreed in December); Big Tech would feel pressure from open-source startups (half right: the open-source boom continues, but AI companies like OpenAI and 
Google DeepMind still stole the limelight); and that AI would change big pharma for good (too soon to tell: the AI revolution in drug discovery is in full swing, but the first drugs developed using AI are still some years from market).
Now we’re doing it again.

# Industrial Applications of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Report


## Executive Summary


The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a significant milestone in the evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of natural language processing. These sophisticated algorithms have the capacity to decipher and generate human language on a massive scale, mirroring human cognition and transforming the way industries engage with data, 
customers, and internal processes. This report delves into the various industrial applications of LLMs, highlighting their use cases, the impact they have on different sectors, and the 
potential they hold for future advancements.


## Introduction


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a driving force behind the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with its influence permeating every sector of industry. LLMs, a subset of AI, have emerged as transformative tools, striving to match and even surpass the innovative capabilities of human minds (Interview Kickstart, n.d.). With approximately 34% of non-major tech organizations planning to integrate LLMs into their workspaces, and around 40% of enterprises aiming to build customized enterprise language models, the adoption of LLMs is on a rapid incline (Interview Kickstart, n.d.).


## LLMs in Industry: Use Cases and Applications


### Content Creation and Business Applications


Businesses across the spectrum, from startups to multinational corporations, are leveraging LLMs for content creation. These models are capable of generating novel content that aligns with brand requirements, understanding context, and suggesting topics based on trends and audience interests (Interview Kickstart, n.d.). In the realm of language translation, LLMs are breaking down language barriers, enabling brands to reach broader audiences and facilitating international communication (Interview Kickstart, n.d.).


### Human Resources Assistance


LLMs are also finding applications in human resources, where they can assist in various HR tasks, potentially streamlining the recruitment process and enhancing employee engagement (Interview Kickstart, n.d.).


### Customer Support Transformation


In customer support, LLMs are revolutionizing interactions by enhancing dialogue systems. Models like GPT-4 and Gemini offer human-like conversations that transcend scripted responses, 
creating more natural and context-aware user experiences (Dataquest, n.d.).


### Manufacturing Sector Optimization


The manufacturing industry is harnessing LLMs to drive automation, improve operational transparency, and accelerate product and technology development. Generative AI and LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are being utilized to understand and organize complex information and generate human-like interactions (World Economic Forum, 2023; Databricks, 2023).


### Healthcare and Finance


LLMs are reshaping sectors like healthcare by aiding in tailored patient care and finance by streamlining decision-making processes. They are projected to create a market worth USD 5.62 billion by 2024, signifying their escalating relevance (Dataquest, n.d.).


### Cybersecurity and Legal Compliance


In cybersecurity, LLMs are being used to map regulations to policies and controls, reducing complex tasks from months to a few days (Forbes, 2024).


### Software Development and Machine Learning


LLMs are expanding AI's impact in fields such as software development and machine learning, where they can answer deep domain questions, comprehend and summarize documents, write stories, and compute programs (VentureBeat, n.d.).


## The Impact of LLMs on Various Sectors


### Healthcare


LLMs have been instrumental in assisting with clinical diagnoses, reducing diagnostic errors by 20% and shortening patient waiting times when tailored to specific operational needs (Forbes, 2024).


### Financial Services


Financial service companies have utilized LLMs to streamline the mapping of regulations to policies and controls, transforming a cumbersome task into an efficient process (Forbes, 2024).


### Manufacturing


The manufacturing industry is leveraging LLMs to increase automation, gain operational visibility, and accelerate product and technology development (Databricks, 2023).


### Customer Experience and Support


LLMs enable companies to deliver personalized customer interactions through chatbots, automate customer support with virtual assistants, and gain valuable insights through sentiment analysis (ProjectPro, n.d.).


## Challenges and Limitations


Despite their potential, LLMs face technical limitations that impact their accuracy and ability to understand context. Domain mismatch and word prediction issues can lead to inaccuracies or overly generic responses when dealing with specialized knowledge (Hatchworks, n.d.). Additionally, the environmental impact of training and maintaining LLMs is a growing concern, with significant energy consumption associated with their operation (Hatchworks, n.d.).


## Conclusion


LLMs are powerful tools that are reshaping the industrial landscape, offering a myriad of applications that enhance efficiency, decision-making, and user experiences. As industries continue to adopt and integrate these models into their operations, we can expect to see further innovation and transformation across various sectors. However, it is crucial to address the 
technical and environmental challenges associated with LLMs to ensure their sustainable and ethical use in the future.
