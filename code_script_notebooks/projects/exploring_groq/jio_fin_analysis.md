## Entry and Exit Strategy for the Coming Week

Considering the current price of INR 344.75 and the identified support and resistance levels, the following strategy is recommended for the coming week:

### Entry Point

An optimal entry point would be near the support level of INR 232.00. However, given the current market price, a more realistic entry could be on a minor pullback to the first downside target of INR 321.35, which could serve as a short-term support level.

### Exit Point

For investors looking to exit, the first upside target of INR 374.50 represents a near-term resistance level. If the stock price approaches this level, it could be an opportune moment to sell and realize profits before potential resistance slows or reverses the upward momentum.

## Conclusion

JIOFIN presents an interesting opportunity for traders and investors in the coming week. The stock is currently in a neutral position with potential for movement in either direction. The identified support and resistance levels provide clear markers for entry and exit points. Investors should monitor these levels closely and be prepared to act if the price approaches either target. As always, it is crucial to consider the broader market conditions and news that may impact the stock's performance.
