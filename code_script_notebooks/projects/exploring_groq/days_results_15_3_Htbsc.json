Wrap the ends with a tiny bit of foil as a precaution before sticking it in the frosting or cream;\\\\\\\\nChocolate Buttercream for a classic Birthday Cake or pastel-coloured buttercream like this Easter Cake;\\\\\\\\nRich Chocolate Fudge \\\\\\\\u2013 frost it with Chocolate Fudge Frosting made with melted chocolate. I don\\\\\\\\u2019t understand the science, all I know is that when I melted the butter in the milk ahead of starting the batter, then let it cool to lukewarm while I faffed around getting everything else ready, the cake didn\\\\\\\\u2019t rise as well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}\\\", \\\"{\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://amycakesbakes.com/how-to-make-moist-cakes/\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"More about me \\\\\\\\u2192\\\\\\\\nWhat's New\\\\\\\\nBaking Resources\\\\\\\\nLatest Web Stories:\\\\\\\\nTop Bakery Recipes\\\\\\\\nBakery Business Resources\\\\\\\\nRecent posts\\\\\\\\nFooter\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u2191 back to top\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\\\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\\\\\nResources\\\\\\\\nLet's Connect!\\\\\\\\n Dee says\\\\\\\\nNovember 21, 2021 at 10:53 am\\\\\\\\nHow much oil do I use to substitute butter\\\\\\\\nAmy says\\\\\\\\nNovember 22, 2021 at 8:11 am\\\\\\\\nI recommend adding vegetable oil in addition to butter if you are not happy with a cake moisture level, but you can also substitute it ounce to ounce.\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\ud83d\\\\\\\\ude42\\\\\\\\nDemnis says\\\\\\\\nNovember 06, 2021 at 11:56 am\\\\\\\\nHow much instant clear gel do you add to a cake recipe?\\\\\\\\nGianna Gregory says\\\\\\\\nJuly 10, 2021 at 12:47 pm\\\\\\\\nThank you for the tips.\\\\\\\\n any suggestions?\\\\\\\\nAmy says\\\\\\\\nNovember 26, 2021 at 10:34 pm\\\\\\\\nHi Asia, it's hard to say without seeing the recipe, but if your recipe already contained buttermilk, vegetable oil and instant clearjel (or instant pudding mix), then you might just need to adjust the ratios--I'd recommend comparing the ratios of all the ingredients (including the flour/sugar/leaveners/eggs) in my extra-moist cake recipes, and then tweak your recipe as needed.\\\\\\\\n Subscribe For Emails\\\\\\\\nLatest on Social Media\\\\\\\\nWeb Stories\\\\\\\\nContact\\\\\\\\nAbout\\\\\\\\nAbout Amy\\\\\\\\nAbout Amycakes Bakery\\\\\\\\nFAQ\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u00b7\\\\\\\\u00a0As an Amazon Associate, I earn from Qualifying Purchases\\\\\\\\u00a0\\\\\\\\u00b7\\\\\\\\nCopyright \\\\\\\\u00a9 2022 Amycakes Bakes, All Rights Reserved\\\\\\\"}\\\", \\\"{\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://recipes.net/articles/how-to-bake-a-soft-cake/\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Creaming the butter and sugar: Beat the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy.
