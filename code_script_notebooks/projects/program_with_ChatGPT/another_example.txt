Sure, here are two capstone projects that involve customer data management and developing a full-stack application for e-commerce:

## Capstone Project 1: Customer Data Management System

### Problem Statement:
A company wants to develop a customer data management system that can store and manage customer information such as name, address, phone number, email, and purchase history. The system should allow the company to add, update, and delete customer information, as well as search for customers based on specific criteria.

### Solution:
1. Define the data model: Create a database schema that includes tables for customers, orders, and products. Use SQL to create the tables and define the relationships between them.
2. Build the user interface: Develop a web-based user interface that allows the company to add, update, and delete customer information. Use a framework like Flask or Django to build the interface.
3. Implement search functionality: Develop a search function that allows the company to search for customers based on specific criteria, such as name, address, or purchase history.
4. Secure the system: Implement security measures to protect customer data, such as encryption and access controls.

### Python Code Example:
Here is an example of how to create a customer table in SQLite using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('customer_data.db')

# Create a cursor object
c = conn.cursor()

# Create the customer table
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE customers
             (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
              name TEXT,
              address TEXT,
              phone TEXT,
              email TEXT,
              purchase_history TEXT)''')

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```

## Capstone Project 2: Full-Stack E-Commerce Application

### Problem Statement:
A company wants to develop a full-stack e-commerce application that allows customers to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and checkout. The application should also allow the company to manage products, orders, and customer information.

### Solution:
1. Define the data model: Create a database schema that includes tables for products, orders, and customers. Use SQL to create the tables and define the relationships between them.
2. Build the user interface: Develop a web-based user interface that allows customers to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and checkout. Use a framework like Flask or Django to build the interface.
3. Implement payment processing: Integrate a payment processing system like Stripe or PayPal to handle payments.
4. Implement order management: Develop a system for managing orders, including order fulfillment and shipping.
5. Secure the system: Implement security measures to protect customer data and prevent fraud.

### Python Code Example:
Here is an example of how to create a product table in SQLite using Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('ecommerce_data.db')

# Create a cursor object
c = conn.cursor()

# Create the product table
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE products
             (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
              name TEXT,
              description TEXT,
              price REAL,
              image_url TEXT)''')

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()

problem statement, step by step thinking about the solution.
After that provide the Python code of the following steps. 
Define the data model, Build the user interface, Implement payment processing,
Implement order management, Secure the system.******Completion starts****** 
Capstone Project 1: Customer Data Management System

Problem Statement:
A company wants to develop a customer data management system to store and manage customer information. The system should allow the company to add, edit, and delete customer information, as well as search for customers based on various criteria.

Step by Step Solution:
1. Define the data model: The data model should include fields for customer name, address, phone number, email address, and any other relevant information.
2. Build the user interface: The user interface should allow the user to add, edit, and delete customer information, as well as search for customers based on various criteria.
3. Implement payment processing: Payment processing is not required for this project.
4. Implement order management: Order management is not required for this project.
5. Secure the system: The system should be secured with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Python Code:

1. Define the data model:

```
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name, address, phone_number, email):
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.phone_number = phone_number
        self.email = email
```

2. Build the user interface:

```
def add_customer():
    name = input("Enter customer name: ")
    address = input("Enter customer address: ")
    phone_number = input("Enter customer phone number: ")
    email = input("Enter customer email: ")
    customer = Customer(name, address, phone_number, email)
    # Add customer to database

def edit_customer():
    # Get customer by ID
    # Update customer information
    # Save changes to database

def delete_customer():
    # Get customer by ID
    # Delete customer from database

def search_customer():
    # Search for customers based on various criteria
```

3. Implement payment processing: Payment processing is not required for this project.

4. Implement order management: Order management is not required for this project.

5. Secure the system: The system should be secured with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Capstone Project 2: Developing Full Stack Application for E-commerce

        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.price = price

class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name, address, phone_number, email):
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.phone_number = phone_number
