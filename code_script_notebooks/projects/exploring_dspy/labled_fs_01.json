        "gold_reasoning": "The total marks Amaya scored more in Music than in Maths is 1\/10 * 70 = <<1\/10*70=7>>7 marks. So the total marks she scored in Maths is 70 - 7 = <<70-7=63>>63 marks. If she scored 20 marks fewer in Maths than in Arts, then he scored 63 + 20 = <<63+20=83>>83 in Arts. If she scored 10 marks more in Social Studies than in Music, then she scored 70 + 10 = <<10+70=80>>80 marks in Social Studies. The total number of marks for all the subjects is 70 + 63 + 83 + 80 = <<70+63+83+80=296>>296 marks.",

How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?",

Sam counted 4 more shooting stars than did Reginald, or a total of 12+4=16 shooting stars. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them was (14+12+16)\/3 = <<14=14>>14 shooting stars.

Coming down, Stephen covered another 30000 feet, making the total distance covered in one round to be 30000+30000 = <<30000+30000=60000>>60000. Since Stephen made 10 round trips up and down the mountain, he covered 10*60000 = <<10*60000=600000>>600000",
