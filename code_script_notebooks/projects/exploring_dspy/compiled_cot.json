This means he covered 3\/4 * 40,000 feet = 30,000 feet on each trip. Since he made 10 round trips, the total distance he covered is 30,000 feet * 10 trips * 2 (round trip) = 600,000 feet.",

How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. The total number of shooting stars counted by the three of them is 14 + 12 + 16 = 42. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is 42 \/ 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.",
