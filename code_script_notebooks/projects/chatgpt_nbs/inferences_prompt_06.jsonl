This question would require more information than is given in the dataset so you would use some reasonable estimation.

In many cases the system is incrementally building a representation of the language of the user becoming familiar 'Insight'. This system is not able to use context as well as a human but it is able to find insight in as little as 1 line of text.\n\nMany unstructured data analysis companies offer a web-based version of the same insights. MatrixFactorData.com uses natural language search in a web-based application which is slowly teaching the system the most common patterns of text found in these specific datasets. \nAs you can see the MatrixFactorData.com system is still very simple. We intend to use this system to build a more complete explanation of the relationships between the rows found in these datasets.\n\nThere are many disadvantages to using any Relational Database System for unstructured data analysis. These systems are restricted to simple navigational units and also cannot use statistical techniques. There also exists the problem that in order to compare the entire dataset to a single query a user is required to sort the entire dataset and use a row_number() type clause for the compare.\n\nDuring the processing of any unstructured data the structure of the documents will change. This can affect the capacity of the system to allow fast access to the data and certain statistical techniques. Using the traditional model we are operating in an environment were the computerized data structure is separate from the human interpretation of the contents of the document. Any row_number() type clause cannot be probabilistic, therefore"}
