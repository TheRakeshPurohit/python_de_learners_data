    Answer:
    ******Completion starts****** 
There are a total of three passengers who travelled from Earth, based on the given dataset.
    There are a total of two passengers who travelled from Europa, based on the given dataset.
    It is not specified in the dataset what the mode of transport was, so we cannot determine the most common mode of transport used by the passengers.
    The average VIP score of the passengers cannot be accurately determined as there are missing values in the dataset. However, for the available data, the average VIP score would be 44.2 (calculated using the available data points).
    The minimum VIP score of the passengers is 0.
    The maximum VIP score of the passengers is 1125.
    There are a total of three passengers who were classified as VIPs, based on the given dataset.
    Two passengers had room service during their journey.
    Three passengers had access to a food court during their journey.

What was the average VIP score of the passengers? What was the minimum VIP score of the passengers? What was the maximum VIP score of the passengers? How many passengers were classified as VIPs?

    Answer:
    ******Completion starts****** 
Based on the provided dataset, it cannot be determined how many passengers travelled from Earth or Europa. However, it can be noted that the destinations of the passengers include TRAPPIST-1e, PSO J318.5-22, and 55 Cancri e.

The dataset does not provide information on the mode of transport used by the passengers.

To calculate the average VIP score of the passengers, we need to first identify the VIP passengers and obtain their VIP scores. From the dataset, it can be determined that there were 3 passengers classified as VIPs, with VIP scores of 58, 45, and 14 respectively. Thus, the average VIP score of the passengers would be (58+45+14)/3 = 39.

The minimum and maximum VIP scores of the passengers can also be determined from the dataset, with the minimum being 14 and the maximum being 58.

A total of 3 passengers were classified as VIPs.

From the dataset, it can be determined that 3 passengers had room service during their journey.

Only 1 passenger had access to a food court during their journey.
