The DISTINCT function returns only unique values from a given column. Therefore, by applying DISTINCT to the HomePlanet column, we can determine that there are 3 different home planets represented in the dataset.\n\nThe most common home planet can be determined by counting the frequency of each Home planet using the GROUP BY function. Therefore, by grouping the HomePlanet column and counting the number of appearances of each planet, we can determine that Mars is the most common home planet with 4 passengers from there.\n\nTo determine the number of passengers in Cryosleep, we can count the number of True values in the CryoSleep column. Thus, we can determine that 2 passengers are in cryosleep.\n\nTo determine the percentage of passengers in Cryosleep, we can divide the number of passengers in Cryosleep by the total number of passengers and multiply by 100. Therefore, the percentage of passengers in Cryosleep is 18.18%.\n\nTo determine the distribution of cabins among the passengers, we can group the Cabin column and count the frequency of each cabin type. It shows that cabins are of different types like C, F, and G. Cabin C appears 2 times, Cabin F appears 4 times, and Cabin G appears 2 times.\n\nThe most common cabin type can be determined by selecting the cabin type with the highest frequency among all passengers. Therefore, Cabin F is the most common Cabin type, with 4 passengers having it.\n\nTo determine the most common destination, we can group the Destination column and calculate the count of each unique destination. Thus, 5 passengers have TRAPPIST-1e as their destination.\n\nTo determine how many passengers are VIPs, we can count the number of True values in the VIP column. Therefore, only 1 passenger is a VIP.\n\nTo determine the percentage of passengers who are VIPs, we can divide the number of VIP passengers by the total number of passengers and multiply by 100. As a result, only 9.09% of the passengers are VIPs.\n\nFinally, we conclude that there are 3 different Home planets represented in the given dataset, Mars is the most common home planet, and 2 passengers are in Cryosleep. Moreover, the percentage of passengers in cryosleep is 18.18%. The distribution of cabins includes C, F, and G cabins, with F being the most common cabin type. Also, TRAPPIST-1e is the most common destination, and only 1 passenger out of 11 total passengers is a VIP."}
