By contrast, the Sun\\'s surface temperature is approximately 5800\\xa0K. Recent analysis of SOHO mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the radiative zone above.[55] Through most of the Sun\\'s life, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through the proton–proton chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium.[58] Currently, only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the CNO cycle, though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older and more luminous.[59][60]\\nThe core is the only region on the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the power is generated within 24% of the Sun\\'s radius, and by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly entirely. In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause.[87] In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium,[88] and indeed did so August 25, 2012 at approximately 122 astronomical units (18 Tm) from the Sun.[89] The heliosphere has a heliotail which stretches out behind it due to the Sun\\'s movement.[90]\\nOn April 28, 2021, during its eighth flyby of the Sun, NASA\\'s Parker Solar Probe encountered the specific magnetic and particle conditions at 18.8 solar radii that indicated that it penetrated the Alfvén surface, the boundary separating the corona from the solar wind defined as where the coronal plasma\\'s Alfvén speed and the large-scale solar wind speed are equal.[91][92] The orbits of the inner planets, including those of the Earth, are similarly displaced by the same gravitational forces, so the movement of the Sun has little effect on the relative positions of the Earth and the Sun or on solar irradiance on the Earth as a function of time.[149]\\nCelestial neighborhood\\nThe Solar System is surrounded by the Local Interstellar Cloud, although it is not clear if it is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud or if it lies just outside the cloud\\'s edge.[151][152] Multiple other interstellar clouds also exist in the region within 300 light-years of the Sun, known as the Local Bubble.[152] Regarding the fixed stars, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the ecliptic through the zodiac, and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven planets (Greek planetes, \"wanderer\"); the naming of the days of the weeks after the seven planets dates to the Roman era.[230][231][232]\\nIn Proto-Indo-European religion, the Sun was personified as the goddess *Seh2ul.[233][234] Derivatives of this goddess in Indo-European languages include the Old Norse Sól, Sanskrit Surya, Gaulish Sulis, Lithuanian Saulė, and Slavic Solntse.[234]'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",
