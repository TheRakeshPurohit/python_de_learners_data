2023-04-26 10:44:41+05:30Was this a lucky shot? Although many amazing photographs are taken by someone who just happenedÂ to be in the right place at the right time, this image took skill and careful planning. First was the angularÂ scale: if you shoot too close to the famous Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, the full moon will appear too small.Â  Conversely, if you shoot from too far away, the moon willÂ appearÂ  too large and not fit inside the Arc. Second is timing: the Moon only appears centered inside the Arc for small periods of time -- from this distance less than a minute. Other planned features include lighting, relative brightness, height, capturing a good foreground, and digital processing. And yes, there is some luck involved -- for example, the sky must be clear. This time, the planning was successful, bringing two of humanity's most famous icons photographically together for all to enjoy.April 26, 2023via NASA https://ift.tt/Q97cCjP            Manage    Unsubscribe       from these notifications or sign in to manage your    Email service.IFTTT	Manage on IFTTT:	https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/95937891

Astronomy Picture of the Day:
2023-04-25 10:45:18+05:30Did you see an aurora over the past two nights? Many people who don't live in Earth's far north did. Reports of aurora came in not only from northern locales in the USA as Alaska, but as far south as Texas and Arizona. A huge auroral oval extended over Europe and Asia, too. Pictured, an impressively red aurora was captured last night near the town of CÃ¡ceres in central Spain. Auroras were also reported in parts of southern Spain. The auroras resulted from a strong Coronal Mass Event (CME) that occurred on the Sun a few days ago. Particles from the CME crossed the inner Solar System before colliding with the Earth's magnetosphere. From there, electrons and protons spiraled down the Earth's northern magnetic field lines and collided with oxygen and nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere, causing picturesque auroral glows. Our unusually active Sun may provide future opportunities to see the northern lights in southern skies.April 25, 2023via NASA https://ift.tt/q9hd7Zc            Manage    Unsubscribe       from these notifications or sign in to manage your    Email service.IFTTT	Manage on IFTTT:	https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/95937891

Astronomy Picture of the Day:
2023-04-24 09:43:37+05:30What powers this unusual nebula? CTB-1 is the expanding gas shell that was left when a massive star toward the constellation of Cassiopeia exploded about 10,000 years ago. The star likely detonated when it ran out of elements near its core that could create stabilizing pressure with nuclear fusion. The resulting supernova remnant, nicknamed the Medulla Nebula for its brain-like shape, still glows in visible light by the heat generated by its collision with confining interstellar gas. Why the nebula also glows in X-ray light, though, remains a mystery. One hypothesis holds that an energetic pulsar was co-created that powers the nebula with a fast outwardly moving wind. Following this lead, a pulsar has recently been found in radio waves that appears to have been expelled by the supernova explosion at over 1000 kilometers per second. Although the Medulla Nebula appears as large as a full moon, it is so faint that it took many hours of exposure with a telescope in Seven Persons, Alberta , Canada to create the featured image.April 24, 2023via NASA https://ift.tt/roC16qfManageUnsubscribe from these notifications or sign in to manage your Email service.IFTTT	Manage on IFTTT:	https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/95937891

Astronomy Picture of the Day:
2023-04-23 10:46:46+05:30What's happening over the water? Pictured here is one of the better images yet recorded of a waterspout, a type of tornado that occurs over water. Waterspouts are spinning columns of rising moist air that typically form over warm water. Waterspouts can be as dangerous as tornadoes and can feature wind speeds over 200 kilometers per hour. Some waterspouts form away from thunderstorms and even during relatively fair weather. Waterspouts may be relatively transparent and initially visible only by an unusual pattern they create on the water. The featured image was taken in 2013 July near Tampa Bay, Florida. The Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida is arguably the most active area in the world for waterspouts, with hundreds forming each year.April 23, 2023via NASA https://ift.tt/x95PbhyManageUnsubscribe from these notifications or sign in to manage your Email service.IFTTT	Manage on IFTTT:	https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/95937891

Astronomy Picture of the Day: NGC 1333: Stellar Nursery in Perseus
2023-04-22 09:43:17+05:30NGC 1333: Stellar Nursery in PerseusIn visible light NGC 1333 is seen as a reflection nebula, dominated by bluish hues characteristic of starlight reflected by interstellar dust. A mere 1,000 light-years distant toward the heroic constellation Perseus, it lies at the edge of a large, star-forming molecular cloud. This Hubble Space Telescope close-up frames a region just over 1 light-year wide at the estimated distance of NGC 1333. It shows details of the dusty region along with telltale hints of contrasty red emission from Herbig-Haro objects, jets and shocked glowing gas emanating from recently formed stars. In fact, NGC 1333 contains hundreds of stars less than a million years old, most still hidden from optical telescopes by the pervasive stardust. The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Hubble's stunning image of the stellar nursery was released to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the space telescope's launch.April 22, 2023via NASA https://ift.tt/8u3cfsWManageUnsubscribe from these notifications or sign in to manage your Email service.IFTTT	Manage on IFTTT:	https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/95937891
