What kind of authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented for accessing the API?", "2. How should errors and exceptions be handled in the API responses?", "3. Should there be any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms in place for API requests?", "4. How should the API handle large amounts of data retrieval efficiently?", "5. Should there be any caching strategies implemented for improving API performance?", "6. What format should the API responses be in (e.g., JSON, XML)?", "7. Should there be any validation checks for the data being sent in API requests?", "8. How should the API documentation be generated and maintained for developers using the API?", "9. Are there any specific security measures that need to be implemented for protecting the API and the data?", "10. How should the API handle concurrent requests and ensure data consistency in the database?"]}
