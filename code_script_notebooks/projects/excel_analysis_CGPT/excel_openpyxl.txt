 I have a data_in_excel.xlsx file having data
inside Database worksheet. Tell me how to 
1) Import excel file data into Python openpyxl library
2) List the commands to create charts using the data in openpyxl******Completion starts****** 
Sure, I can help you with that.

1) To import excel file data into Python openpyxl library, you can use the following code:

```python
import openpyxl

# Load the workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('data_in_excel.xlsx')

# Select the worksheet
worksheet = workbook['Database']

# Access the cell values
for row in worksheet.iter_rows(values_only=True):
    print(row)
```

This code will load the `data_in_excel.xlsx` file and select the `Database` worksheet. It will then iterate through all the rows in the worksheet and print the cell values.

2) To create charts using the data in openpyxl, you can use the following commands:

```python
import openpyxl
from openpyxl.chart import BarChart, Reference

# Load the workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('data_in_excel.xlsx')

# Select the worksheet
worksheet = workbook['Database']

# Create a reference to the data
data = Reference(worksheet, min_col=2, min_row=2, max_col=3, max_row=6)

# Create a bar chart
chart = BarChart()
chart.add_data(data)

# Add titles and labels
chart.title = "Sales Data"
chart.x_axis.title = "Product"
chart.y_axis.title = "Sales"

# Add the chart to the worksheet
worksheet.add_chart(chart, "E2")

# Save the workbook
workbook.save('data_in_excel.xlsx')
```

This code will load the `data_in_excel.xlsx` file and select the `Database` worksheet. It will then create a reference to the data in columns B and C, and create a bar chart using that data. The chart will have titles and labels, and will be added to the worksheet at cell E2. Finally, the workbook will be saved with the chart added.*****Completion ends******

 I am unable to understand the following 
openpyxl commands. 
# Create a reference to the data
data = Reference(worksheet, min_col=2, min_row=2, max_col=3, max_row=6)

# Create a bar chart
chart = BarChart()
chart.add_data(data)

Could you please explain with example dataset
******Completion starts****** 
Sure, let's say we have the following dataset in an Excel worksheet:

| Name | Sales | Expenses |
|------|-------|----------|
| John | 500   | 300      |
| Jane | 700   | 400      |
| Bob  | 900   | 600      |
| Sue  | 600   | 350      |
| Tom  | 800   | 500      |

The first line of code creates a reference to the data in the worksheet. The `min_col` parameter specifies the starting column (column 2, since we want to exclude the "Name" column), the `min_row` parameter specifies the starting row (row 2, since we want to exclude the header row), the `max_col` parameter specifies the ending column (column 3, since we only want to include the "Sales" and "Expenses" columns), and the `max_row` parameter specifies the ending row (row 6, since we have 5 rows of data).

```python
data = Reference(worksheet, min_col=2, min_row=2, max_col=3, max_row=6)
```

The second line of code creates a bar chart object using the `BarChart()` function. The `add_data()` method is then used to add the data reference we created earlier to the chart.

```python
chart = BarChart()
chart.add_data(data)
```

This will create a simple bar chart with two bars (one for "Sales" and one for "Expenses") for each of the five people in the dataset.*****Completion ends******

 I would like to see the excel worksheet data in tabular format 
inside openpyxl. Could you provide me the commands for the same. 
Also provide explanation with a made up example dataset ******Completion starts****** 
Sure, I can help you with that. Here's an example code that reads a dataset from a CSV file and writes it to an Excel worksheet using Openpyxl:

```python
import openpyxl
import csv

# Load the CSV file
with open('example.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    data = list(reader)

# Create a new workbook and select the active worksheet
workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()
worksheet = workbook.active

# Write the data to the worksheet
for row in data:
    worksheet.append(row)

# Save the workbook
workbook.save('example.xlsx')
```

In this example, we first load the dataset from a CSV file using the `csv` module. We then create a new workbook and select the active worksheet using the `openpyxl` module. We then loop through each row in the dataset and append it to the worksheet using the `append()` method. Finally, we save the workbook to an Excel file using the `save()` method.

Let's assume that the `example.csv` file contains the following data:

```
Name, Age, Gender
John, 25, Male
Jane, 30, Female
Bob, 40, Male
```

When we run the above code, it will create a new Excel file called `example.xlsx` with the following data in the first worksheet:

| Name | Age | Gender |
|------|-----|--------|
| John | 25  | Male   |
| Jane | 30  | Female |
| Bob  | 40  | Male   |

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.*****Completion ends******

 Please provide me top 5 only pivot tables related 
commands that I can use to analyze an example excel data that contains 
500 rows and 10 columns in Openpyxl. 
For each command provide me example that I can try out******Completion starts****** 
Sure, here are the top 5 pivot table related commands that you can use to analyze your Excel data using Openpyxl:

1. Create a Pivot Table: You can create a pivot table using the `pivot_table` method of the `openpyxl.worksheet` module. This method takes several arguments such as the range of cells to be used for the pivot table, the row and column fields, and the aggregation function to be used. Here's an example:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.utils import range_boundaries
from openpyxl.worksheet.table import Table, TableStyleInfo

# Create a new workbook
wb = Workbook()

# Select the active worksheet
ws = wb.active

# Add some data to the worksheet
ws.append(['Name', 'Category', 'Sales'])
ws.append(['John', 'A', 100])
ws.append(['Jane', 'B', 200])
ws.append(['Bob', 'A', 150])
ws.append(['Alice', 'B', 250])

# Create a pivot table
table = Table(displayName="SalesTable", ref="A1:C5")
table.tableStyleInfo = TableStyleInfo(name="TableStyleMedium9", showFirstColumn=False,
                                      showLastColumn=False, showRowStripes=True, showColumnStripes=False)
ws.add_table(table)

# Save the workbook
wb.save("pivot_table.xlsx")
```

2. Add Filters to a Pivot Table: You can add filters to a pivot table using the `add_filter` method of the `openpyxl.worksheet.table` module. This method takes the name of the field to be used as a filter. Here's an example:

```python
# Add a filter to the pivot table
table.add_filter("Category")

# Save the workbook
wb.save("pivot_table.xlsx")
```

3. Add Calculated Fields to a Pivot Table: You can add calculated fields to a pivot table using the `add_calculated_field` method of the `openpyxl.worksheet.table` module. This method takes the name of the calculated field, the formula to be used, and the data type of the calculated field. Here's an example:

```python
# Add a calculated field to the pivot table
table.add_calculated_field("Total Sales", "Sales*2", "n")

# Save the workbook
wb.save("pivot_table.xlsx")
```

4. Change the Layout of a Pivot Table: You can change the layout of a pivot table using the `change_pivot_table_layout` method of the `openpyxl.worksheet.table` module. This method takes several arguments such as the row and column fields, the data fields, and the aggregation functions to be used. Here's an example:

```python
# Change the layout of the pivot table
table.change_pivot_table_layout(rows=['Category'], columns=['Name'], values=['Sales'], aggfunc='sum')

# Save the workbook
wb.save("pivot_table.xlsx")
```

5. Refresh a Pivot Table: You can refresh a pivot table using the `refresh` method of the `openpyxl.worksheet.table` module. This method refreshes the data in the pivot table based on the source data. Here's an example:

```python
# Refresh the pivot table
table.refresh()

# Save the workbook
wb.save("pivot_table.xlsx")
```

 Please provide me top 5 only vlookup related 
commands that I can use to work with an example excel data that contains 
500 rows and 10 columns in Openpyxl. 
For each command provide me example that I can try out******Completion starts****** 
Sure, here are the top 5 VLOOKUP related commands in Openpyxl that you can use to work with your Excel data:

1. `openpyxl.utils.cell.range_boundaries()` - This command returns the boundaries of a range of cells in a worksheet. You can use this command to define the range of cells that you want to perform a VLOOKUP on.

Example:

```python
from openpyxl.utils.cell import range_boundaries

# Define the range of cells to perform VLOOKUP on
range_start = 'A2'
range_end = 'B501'
range_boundaries(range_start + ':' + range_end)
```

2. `openpyxl.utils.cell.column_index_from_string()` - This command returns the numerical index of a column in a worksheet based on its letter representation. You can use this command to convert the column letter in your VLOOKUP formula to its corresponding numerical index.

Example:

```python
from openpyxl.utils.cell import column_index_from_string

# Convert column letter to numerical index
column_letter = 'B'
column_index_from_string(column_letter)
```

3. `openpyxl.utils.cell.get_column_letter()` - This command returns the letter representation of a column in a worksheet based on its numerical index. You can use this command to convert the numerical index in your VLOOKUP formula to its corresponding column letter.

Example:

```python
from openpyxl.utils.cell import get_column_letter

# Convert numerical index to column letter
column_index = 2
get_column_letter(column_index)
```

4. `openpyxl.worksheet.worksheet.Worksheet.iter_rows()` - This command returns a generator that iterates over the rows in a worksheet. You can use this command to loop through the rows in your worksheet and perform a VLOOKUP on each row.

Example:

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load the workbook
workbook = load_workbook('example.xlsx')

# Select the worksheet
worksheet = workbook['Sheet1']

# Define the range of cells to perform VLOOKUP on
range_start = 'A2'
range_end = 'B501'

# Loop through the rows in the worksheet and perform a VLOOKUP on each row
for row in worksheet.iter_rows(range_string=range_start + ':' + range_end):
    # Perform VLOOKUP on the row
    pass
```

5. `openpyxl.cell.cell.Cell.value` - This command returns the value of a cell in a worksheet. You can use this command to retrieve the value of the lookup value in your VLOOKUP formula.

Example:

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load the workbook
workbook = load_workbook('example.xlsx')

# Select the worksheet
worksheet = workbook['Sheet1']

# Retrieve the value of the lookup value in cell A2
lookup_value = worksheet['A2'].value
