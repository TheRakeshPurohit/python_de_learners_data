 I have a data_in_excel.xlsx file having data
inside Database worksheet. Tell me how to 
1) Import excel file data into Python pandas library
2) List top 5 Pandas commands I can use to Analyse the data
3) Import excel file data into Python openpyxl library
4) List the commands to create charts using the data in openpyxl******Completion starts****** 
Sure, I can help you with that.

1) Import excel file data into Python pandas library:

To import excel file data into Python pandas library, you can use the `read_excel()` function from pandas. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# read excel file
df = pd.read_excel('data_in_excel.xlsx', sheet_name='Database')

# print first 5 rows of the dataframe
print(df.head())
```

2) List top 5 Pandas commands I can use to Analyse the data:

Here are the top 5 Pandas commands you can use to analyze the data:

- `df.head()`: This command returns the first n rows of the dataframe. By default, n is 5.
- `df.describe()`: This command returns the summary statistics of the numerical columns in the dataframe.
- `df.info()`: This command returns the information about the dataframe, such as the number of rows, columns, data types, and memory usage.
- `df.groupby()`: This command groups the dataframe by one or more columns and applies a function to each group.
- `df.pivot_table()`: This command creates a pivot table from the dataframe.

3) Import excel file data into Python openpyxl library:

To import excel file data into Python openpyxl library, you can use the `load_workbook()` function from openpyxl. Here's an example:

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# load excel file
wb = load_workbook('data_in_excel.xlsx')

# select worksheet
ws = wb['Database']

# print cell value
print(ws['A1'].value)
```

4) List the commands to create charts using the data in openpyxl:

Here are the commands to create charts using the data in openpyxl:

- `openpyxl.chart`: This module contains classes for creating charts in openpyxl.
- `openpyxl.chart.Reference()`: This class creates a reference to a range of cells in the worksheet.
- `openpyxl.chart.Series()`: This class creates a series for the chart.
- `openpyxl.chart.Chart()`: This class creates a chart object.
- `openpyxl.chart.LineChart()`: This class creates a line chart object.
- `openpyxl.chart.BarChart()`: This class creates a bar chart object.
- `openpyxl.chart.PieChart()`: This class creates a pie chart object.
- `openpyxl.chart.Legend()`: This class creates a legend for the chart.
- `openpyxl.chart.Title()`: This class creates a title for the chart.

Here's an example of how to create a line chart using openpyxl:

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook
from openpyxl.chart import Reference, Series, LineChart

# load excel file
wb = load_workbook('data_in_excel.xlsx')

# select worksheet
ws = wb['Database']

# create chart object
chart = LineChart()

# create data series
xvalues = Reference(ws, min_col=1, min_row=2, max_row=11)
yvalues = Reference(ws, min_col=2, min_row=2, max_row=11)
series = Series(values=yvalues, xvalues=xvalues, title='Data')

# add data series to chart
chart.append(series)

# add chart to worksheet
ws.add_chart(chart, 'D1')

# save excel file
wb.save('data_in_excel.xlsx')
```

This code creates a line chart from the data in columns A and B of the worksheet 'Database' and adds it to cell D1 of the same worksheet.*****Completion ends******

 The data is having Date, Customers, Gender, 
Sales Reps, Drinks/Products and Categories columns that are not 
numbers. Provide me 3 examples of df.groupby() and df.pivot_table()
methods using these column******Completion starts****** 
Sure, here are three examples of `df.groupby()` and `df.pivot_table()` methods using the given columns:

Example 1: Using `df.groupby()` to group the data by Gender and calculate the total sales made by each gender.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Group the data by Gender and calculate the total sales made by each gender
gender_sales = df.groupby('Gender')['Sales'].sum()

print(gender_sales)
```

Output:
```
Gender
Female    12000
Male      15000
Name: Sales, dtype: int64
```

Example 2: Using `df.pivot_table()` to create a pivot table that shows the average sales made by each Sales Rep for each Category.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Create a pivot table that shows the average sales made by each Sales Rep for each Category
sales_pivot = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Sales', index='Sales Reps', columns='Categories', aggfunc='mean')

print(sales_pivot)
```

Output:
```
Categories   Coffee  Juice  Smoothie
Sales Reps                           
John          100.0  150.0     200.0
Mary          150.0  200.0     250.0
```

Example 3: Using `df.groupby()` to group the data by Date and calculate the total number of Customers who made a purchase on each date.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Convert the Date column to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Group the data by Date and calculate the total number of Customers who made a purchase on each date
customer_count = df.groupby('Date')['Customers'].count()

print(customer_count)
```

Output:
```
Date
2021-01-01    3
2021-01-02    2
2021-01-03    2
Name: Customers, dtype: int64

 The data is having Sales Reps, Drinks/Products and 
Categories columns that are categories. There are Sals Price, Cost
and Qty columns that are numbers. Tell me how I can get Profit for 
each sale in this dataset. Then Provide me 5 examples of 
df.groupby() methods using these column. Include the Profit column
also.******Completion starts****** 
To get the profit for each sale in the dataset, we can create a new column called "Profit" which is the difference between the Sales Price and Cost columns. We can do this using the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# read in the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# create a new column for profit
df['Profit'] = df['Sales Price'] - df['Cost']

# view the updated dataframe
print(df.head())
```

This will add a new column called "Profit" to the dataframe, which is the difference between the Sales Price and Cost columns.

Now, here are 5 examples of `df.groupby()` methods using the Profit column:

1. Group by Sales Rep and calculate the total profit for each rep:

```python
rep_profit = df.groupby('Sales Rep')['Profit'].sum()
print(rep_profit)
```

2. Group by Category and calculate the average profit for each category:

```python
cat_profit = df.groupby('Category')['Profit'].mean()
print(cat_profit)
```

3. Group by Product and calculate the maximum profit for each product:

```python
prod_profit = df.groupby('Product')['Profit'].max()
print(prod_profit)
```

4. Group by Sales Rep and Category and calculate the total profit for each combination:

```python
rep_cat_profit = df.groupby(['Sales Rep', 'Category'])['Profit'].sum()
print(rep_cat_profit)
```

5. Group by Sales Rep and Product and calculate the average profit for each combination:

```python
rep_prod_profit = df.groupby(['Sales Rep', 'Product'])['Profit'].mean()
print(rep_prod_profit)
```

In each of these examples, we are grouping the dataframe by one or more columns and then performing an operation on the Profit column. The resulting output shows the calculated value for each group.*****Completion ends******

 I have 10 excel sheets with data in Database worksheet.
Data is having Sales Reps, Drinks/Products and Categories columns that are 
categories. There are Sals Price, Cost and Profit columns that are numbers. 
Provide me a python script that loads the data from excel in pandas, 
analysis it using 

1) 5 pandas groupby method
2) 5 pivot_table method

and then writes the result to excel file called 'results_excel.xlsx'******Completion starts****** 
Sure, here's a Python script that should do what you're asking for:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data from the 10 Excel sheets into a single DataFrame
df = pd.concat(pd.read_excel('data.xlsx', sheet_name=None), ignore_index=True)

# Perform 5 groupby analyses
groupby1 = df.groupby('Sales Rep')['Sales Price'].sum()
groupby2 = df.groupby('Drinks/Products')['Sales Price'].sum()
groupby3 = df.groupby('Categories')['Sales Price'].sum()
groupby4 = df.groupby(['Sales Rep', 'Categories'])['Sales Price'].sum()
groupby5 = df.groupby(['Drinks/Products', 'Categories'])['Sales Price'].sum()

# Perform 5 pivot table analyses
pivot1 = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Sales Price', index='Sales Rep', columns='Categories', aggfunc='sum')
pivot2 = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Sales Price', index='Drinks/Products', columns='Categories', aggfunc='sum')
pivot3 = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Sales Price', index='Sales Rep', columns='Drinks/Products', aggfunc='sum')
pivot4 = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Sales Price', index='Categories', columns='Sales Rep', aggfunc='sum')
pivot5 = pd.pivot_table(df, values='Sales Price', index='Categories', columns='Drinks/Products', aggfunc='sum')

# Write the results to an Excel file
with pd.ExcelWriter('results_excel.xlsx') as writer:
    groupby1.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Groupby 1')
    groupby2.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Groupby 2')
    groupby3.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Groupby 3')
    groupby4.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Groupby 4')
    groupby5.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Groupby 5')
    pivot1.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Pivot 1')
    pivot2.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Pivot 2')
    pivot3.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Pivot 3')
    pivot4.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Pivot 4')
    pivot5.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Pivot 5')
```

This script assumes that your Excel file is named 'data.xlsx' and that the 10 sheets containing the data are all named 'Database'. If your file and sheet names are different, you'll need to adjust the script accordingly.*****Completion ends******
