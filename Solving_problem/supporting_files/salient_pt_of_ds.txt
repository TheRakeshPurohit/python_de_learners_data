Data Structure: Tuples
Introduction:
Tuples are a data structure in Python that are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are assigned.

1. Immutable:

2. Ordered:
Tuples are ordered, which means the elements in a tuple can be accessed by their index. The order of the elements remains the same as they were originally defined.

3. Heterogeneous:
Tuples can contain elements of different data types. For example, a tuple can have a combination of integers, strings, booleans, or even other tuples.

4. Parentheses:
Tuples are defined using parentheses () and elements are separated by commas. This distinguishes tuples from lists which are defined using square brackets [].

5. Hashable:
Tuples are hashable, which means they can be used as keys in dictionaries. This makes them useful when creating dictionaries that require unique keys and immutable values.
