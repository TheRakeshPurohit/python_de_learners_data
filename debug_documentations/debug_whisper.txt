## Debugging process used of Whisper.cpp 

Error :  #include <SDL.h> is missing when trying to do "make stream"

Root cause mentioned in above SO link is Simple Direct Media Layer application is missing in 
the system. Need to install it using the below 

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

Additionally install 

apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev

Add the headers
#include <SDL2/SDL_image.h>
#include <SDL2/SDL_ttf.h>
#include <SDL2/SDL_mixer.h>  

Compiler linker commands

-lSDL2_image
-lSDL2_ttf
-lSDL2_mixer

Outcome: The above installation failed in Kali. Most probably the files that 
were required couldn't be located in the apt-repo. Need to debug more.
